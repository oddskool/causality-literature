# causality ^ learning: a literature review


## Â RL or not

- **performative prediction** [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06673) - Performative stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction
- **Whynot** [github](https://github.com/zykls/whynot) - experimental sandbox for decisions in dynamics, connecting tools from causal inference and reinforcement learning with challenging dynamic environments


## Off-policy 

- **Retrace** [nips](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6538-safe-and-efficient-off-policy-reinforcement-learning.pdf) - Safe and efficient off-policy reinforcement learning
- **DQN replay benchmark** [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04543v3.pdf) - An Optimistic Perspective on Offline Reinforcement Learning
